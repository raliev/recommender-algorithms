### Top 50 Frequent Itemsets (by Support)
This table displays the itemsets (groups of items) that appear together in transactions more frequently than the `min_support` threshold. This list is generated by the Eclat algorithm .

* **`support`**: The fraction of all transactions that contain this itemset .
* **`itemsets`**: The group of items.
* **What to look for:** These are the foundational patterns from which rules are generated. If this list is empty, your `min_support` is too high.

### Top 100 Association Rules (by Confidence)
This table displays the "if-then" rules generated from the frequent itemsets and filtered by your `min_confidence` setting.

* **`antecedents` (IF)**: The item(s) a user has already interacted with.
* **`consequents` (THEN)**: The item(s) the model will recommend.
* **`confidence`**: The probability that a user will interact with the `consequents` *given* they have interacted with the `antecedents`. The prediction score is based on this value .
* **`lift`**: Measures how much more likely the `consequents` are to be recommended given the `antecedents`, compared to by random chance . A lift > 1 indicates a positive correlation.
* **`support`**: The fraction of all transactions containing *both* the antecedents and consequents.
