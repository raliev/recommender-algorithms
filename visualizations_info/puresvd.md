### Scree Plot
The scree plot shows the "variance explained" (derived from the singular values, $\sigma_i^2$) for each component, sorted in descending order.
* **Individual Variance:** The blue bars show how much variance each single component captures.
* **Cumulative Variance:** The red line shows the total variance captured by using components 1 through $k$.
* **k-line:** The dashed line shows the `k` you selected.

The "elbow" of the bar chart is a common heuristic for choosing an optimal `k`, as it represents the point of diminishing returns where adding more components explains significantly less new variance.

### Snapshots
These plots visualize the final latent factor matrices $P$ (User Factors) and $Q$ (Item Factors) generated by the SVD decomposition.
* **Heatmaps:** Show the magnitude of values across a sample of users/items and their factors.
* **Histograms:** Show the distribution of all values within the $P$ and $Q$ matrices.
